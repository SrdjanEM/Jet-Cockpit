# Jet Fighter Cockpit Simulation using MikroE Sensors

This project simulates a jet fighter cockpit using various sensors to provide a realistic experience of flying a jet. The setup includes sensors for motion tracking, thermal imaging, altitude monitoring, compass navigation, and airflow measurement. The goal is to use these sensors to create a functional simulation of a jet's cockpit environment, potentially including additional features like audio warnings, image transfer over WiFi, and stepper motor control for wing flaps.

## Project Overview

This project uses a combination of sensors to simulate various aspects of a jet fighter cockpit:

- **Movement and Orientation Tracking**: Using a 9-axis accelerometer and gyroscope to track the jet's movements and orientation.
- **Thermal Imaging**: An IR Grid sensor for simulating thermal imaging, useful in thermal guidance systems.
- **Altitude Monitoring**: An altitude sensor to monitor the jet's height above ground, with the potential to trigger audio warnings if the altitude is too low.
- **Compass Navigation**: A digital compass sensor for simulating the jet's navigational compass.
- **Airflow Measurement**: An airflow sensor to simulate engine intake measurements.

## Components

The following sensors and components are used in this project:

1. **MPU 9DOF Click (MIKROE-1719)**: A 9-axis sensor combining an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer for movement and orientation tracking.
2. **IR Grid 3 Click (MIKROE-3217)**: An infrared imaging sensor for thermal imaging.
3. **Altitude Click (MIKROE-1489)**: A barometric pressure sensor for altitude measurement.
4. **Compass 2 Click (MIKROE-2264)**: A magnetometer for compass functionality.
5. **Air Flow Click (MIKROE-4677)**: A sensor for measuring air flow, useful for simulating engine intake.

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Hardware Connections**:
   - Connect each sensor to the corresponding mikroBUS slots on the development board.
   - Ensure proper power supply and communication lines (I2C/SPI) are connected as per each sensor's requirements.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the required libraries for each sensor from the MikroE website or relevant repositories.
   - Configure the sensors in the software, initializing them and setting up the necessary data collection methods.

## Functionality

- **Movement Tracking**: The MPU 9DOF Click will continuously track the jet's orientation and acceleration. This data can be used to simulate pitch, roll, and yaw movements.
- **Thermal Imaging**: The IR Grid 3 Click will provide a thermal image grid that can be used for thermal targeting or environmental awareness.
- **Altitude Monitoring**: The Altitude Click sensor will monitor the current altitude. If the altitude drops below a predefined threshold, an audio warning will be triggered.
- **Compass Navigation**: The Compass 2 Click will provide real-time heading information, simulating a compass.
- **Airflow Measurement**: The Air Flow Click will measure the airflow, which can be used to simulate engine intake dynamics.

## Future Enhancements

- **Audio Warnings**: Integrate a speaker to provide audible alerts, such as warnings for low altitude or critical flight conditions.
- **Image Transfer via WiFi**: Use DMA and a WiFi Click module to transfer thermal images or other sensor data over WiFi for remote monitoring or analysis.
- **Stepper Motor Control**: Implement a stepper motor to simulate control surfaces like wing flaps, enhancing the realism of the simulation.
